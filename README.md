# BookRecommender

Project Description:

This project aims at Building a Book Recommendation System by using the Book Crossing dataset which was collected by Cai-   Nicolas Ziegler in 2004. It contains 278,858 user data and provides 1,149,780 ratings (explicit / implicit) and about     271,379 books. 
The dataset can be downloaded as a zip from [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).

### Preview of data:
* Books Data (BX-Books.csv) 

  Columns: ISBN', 'title', 'author', 'yearOfPublication', 'publisher', 'imageUrlS', 'imageUrlM', 'imageUrlL'

* Ratings data (BX-Book-Ratings.csv)

  Columns: userID', 'ISBN', 'rating'(implicit/explicit)

* User Data(BX-Users.csv)

  Columns: 'userID', 'location', 'age' 


## This project contains two Notebooks:
1. Data Cleaning/Analysis: can be found [here](https://github.com/emilianaambo/BookRecommender/blob/master/notebooks/1%20Data%20Analysis_Cleaning%20Book%20Recommendation.ipynb).

2. Data Modeling (Machine Learning): can be found [here](https://github.com/emilianaambo/BookRecommender/blob/master/notebooks/2%20Machine%20Learning%20Book%20Recommendation.ipynb).

   Achieved using Collaborative filtering: Alternating Least Square matrix (ALS) algorithm.
 
## Data (processed)
**The final cleaned dataset used for the machine learning part** is limited to only 50000 records out of about 383842 (also size limitations, too large to upload on github), just for  test purposes **can be found [here](https://github.com/emilianaambo/BookRecommender/tree/master/data.csv).
